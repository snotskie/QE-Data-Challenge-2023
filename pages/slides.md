> The way I conceived of myself and interacted with the world around me had significantly changed. I felt...a pull to go back to making journal comics to help process this new stage in my life. I set out to make daily comics for six straight months, my only rule being total honesty about my feelings, for better or worse, no matter what.

---
> As the project neared completion, I thought back on how much of an impact seeing people who were trans sharing the stories of their lives had on normalizing my feelings about myself.

---
> [N]ot just stories about the turbulent early stages of transition, but the mundane experiences of day-to-day life. It had been so important to see that life really did go on; that we’re just people with the same wants and needs as anyone else.

# Living Stories, Telling Narratives

---
> [T]he narrative is so neat and tidily wrapped up with a bow, you almost expect to turn the last page to see “and she lived happily ever after. The end.” That sorta thing. But real life isn’t as cut-and dried as all that.

---
> The story of my life kept on going and, as I sit here writing this nine months later, it already feels like so much has happened and changed.

---
> At its core, this series is about the importance of all the small moments that make up the greater whole that is my life as an adult queer woman.
